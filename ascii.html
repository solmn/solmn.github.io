   Hi professor

I have finished all of todayâ€™s assignments. I took me about 3 hour to finish all the assignments. I have created a separate page for each assignment and attached to my hompage page.

FIRST ASSIGNMENT:  ASCIIanimation lab
Link:-  https://solmn.github.io/ascii.html
I have implemented the animation function using function closure. Instead of creating a function for animating each animation type with different animation functions, I created one animation function that takes animation type as a parameter and return a closure. Since the returned closure function has access to the scope of the main animation function the closure holds the reference to the current animation frame index and  i used the closure to modify the animation frame index. This helps me to optimize my code and understand the application of closure  in a real world example.
CHALLENGE:  At first i used many functions for each animation type and trying to optimize was a little bit tricky but in the end since I used the function closure i finally managed to write clean and optimized code.

SECOND ASSIGNMENT:  W1D5 JavaScript functions to use Mocha for the unit tests
Link:  https://solmn.github.io/mochaw1d5functions.html
I have practiced how to write a good unit test scripts in javascript using mocha and chai api. It's really interesting to use the api.
CHALLENGE: None


THIRD ASSIGNMENT:   Write your own implementation of map and filter functions
LInk:  https://solmn.github.io/myFunctionalApi.html
Very interesting assignment. I thought implementing my own  functional operations was hard, but its was really very easy for me to implement those two functions. I have also wrote some functions that uses my map and filter function and do something. I also wrote  unit test for those  function using mocha.
CHALLENGE:   None
